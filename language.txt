code blocks

A code block is a set of statements with its own unique scope:
	{
		x: 1;
		y: 2;
	};

A block always evaluates to (returns) something or links into another. If the final line in a block has no semicolon, it is assumed to return. If nothing is returned by this means or the return keyword, the code block will be "unterminated" and will return a pointer to its own scope. Any other lines without a semicolon will result in a syntax or semantic error, depending on whether following lines accidentally continue the unterminated line with valid syntax.

scope cascades from one nested block to the next. If a name is not found in the local scope, above scopes will be searched.

variables are declared and defined in name:value syntax like an object in other languages:

	x: 1;
	y: 2;
	
This is to reduce the ambiguity that may occur when code is spoken. {x: 1} should be read as "x becomes 1," and {x = 1} should be read as x equals one.

you may pass values into the local scope of a code block by linking them with a tilde character. Values not passed into the local scope will still be available as detailed above. 

	{codeblock1}~{codeblock2} // codeblock2 now has local access to variables defined in codeblock1.

For a code block to accept values into its local scope, it must declare vacancies. These are typed and named:

	block: $(int x, int y){x + y};
	
Values will file from one code block to the next until the second one runs out of vacancies. variables do not require a type declaration, but they are strictly typed. If a value of the wrong type attempts to link into a code block's scope, a type error will be raised.

the basic types are int, float, char, and null. Types are inferred on delcaration. If addition is performed between these four, it will have a predefined behavior. If a pointer to a code block is the left operator, that code block will be searched for an "add" method. The right operator will be passed into it. A similar situation exists for other built in behaviors.

If outside of a vacancy declaration for a code block, any type name (as well as common declaration keywords such as 'let', 'var' and 'const') will be ignored by the compiler. These can be included for readabliity.

A code block must be terminated by a semicolon if it is the end of a line.

all blocks can be loops and can be condition-controlled; define run conditions before and after block:

	[pre-check]{code}[post-check]
	
the pre-check determines whether the code should be executed; the post-check determines whether it should be executed again. If the pre-check is omitted, it is assumed to be true; if the post-check is omitted, it will be assumed to be false. A successful post-check will always run the pre-check as well. This allows an equivalent to if statements,

	[i < 3]{some code}; // post-check is assumed to be false

an equivalent to do loops,

	{some code; i++}[i < 3]; // pre-check is assumed to be true

an equivalent to while loops,

	[i < 3]{some code; i++}[true]; // post-check always loops the code, but pre-check may prevent it from being run.
	
but no direct equivalent to for loops. Since a for loop is only shorthand for a while loop in most languages, it can be done in one line still:
	
	{0;}~(int i)[i < 3]{some code; i++}[true];

tokens 'if', 'while', 'do', 'for', and the generic 'condition' will be ignored by the compiler and may be included for readability. This means they are not valid names.

	if [i < 3]{
		some code;
	}

a code block that links from another scope depends on that scope's execution to execute.

	[false]{1; 2}~$sum; // sum is unreachable.

a "$" prefix defines code block as dynamic; the block is not evaluated immediately. It maintains a scope as long as its parent scope still exists. This means it can be saved and re-evaluated:

	sum: $(int x, int y){ x + y };
	
It is saved as a pointer.
	
A code block without "$" prefix will "collapse" into its return value after failing to run and is called "static".

Static code blocks will do their post-check before returning. If the check succeeds, the block will run again with its scope preserved. It will only break this cycle if its post-check fails or if return is explicitly called.

to create a static instance of a dynamic code block (essentially running it), prefix it with another "$". Think of the dollar symbols as canceling each other out:
	
	// this is equivalent to a static code block:
	$${some code here;}; 
	
	// this saves the code block and then instantiates it.
	sum: $(int x, int y){x+y};
	$sum;
	
	// note: evaluating a static code block without linking values into its vacancies is valid and assumes the values to be null.

a static code block prefixed with a "!" inside a dynamic code block will collapse into its value once the dynamic code block is evaluated:

	x: 1;
	y: 2;

	sum: $(int x, int y){ !{x} + y };
	
In the above case, the "sum" code block (which behaves like a function) does not behave as one might expect upon looking at it. Because x is inside a static code block prefixed by "!" (called pseudo-static), it is evaluated once and never again, somewhat like a macro. when sum is evaluated, x will always be 1; the code block is equivalent to {1 + y}. If this is intended, x should not be passed into the local scope of sum.

a static block that links into another code block will clear its scope other than the items that file into the second block; the second block will simply take over its old scope.

If a constant is alone on a line (like {0;}), it is unnamed but still added to the local scope. Since items are linked into another scope by index and not by name, you can declare a code block without names and pass it into another block:

	{0; 2;}~$sum;
	
A final type of code block is "unterminated". It is evaluated, but does not collapse into a value. Instead, it evaluates to a pointer to its unterminated scope. It is signed by the "*" character.

	items: *{
		x: 1;
		y: 2	
	}
	
It can also be evaluated:

	$items;

unterminated code blocks' local scope can be accessed from outside by either name or index. To access a named value in a code block, use a ".":

	data: *{
		x: 1;
		y: 2;
		char: 'a';
	};
	data.x++;
	
to access by index, use a "@":

	data: *{1; 2; 3;};
	data@0: data@0 + 1;
	
Arrays can be emulated using a code block and indexing, as seen above. Another example:

	string: *{'h'; 'e'; 'l'; 'l'; 'o'; ' '; 'w'; 'o'; 'r'; 'l'; 'd'; '\0';}; // typing a string in quotes is shorthand for an unterminated code block with its characters as members. This could have also been {string: "hello world"}.
	for {0}~(int i)[i < {string;}~$length] { // assume length is a code block
		if [string@i = ' ']{
			string@i: '_';
		};
	};
	
	//pseudocode for above:
	for character in string:
		if character is a space:
			set character to an underscore
	
as a funny coincidence, most emails are valid syntax:

	foo: *{*{bar: 0;};};
	bar: 0;
	foo@bar.com: 1;

to review, there are 4 different types of code block:

A "static" code block is evaluated into its return value, and then its scope is destroyed:
	
	x: {1 + 2};
	
A "dynamic" code block is not evaluated, and is stored as a pointer to its code:

	sum: ${1 + 2};
	
An "unterminated" code block is evaluated, but its scope is not destroyed and it returns a pointer to its final state:

	array: *{1; 2; 3;};
	object: *{x: 2; y: 3;};
	
a "pseudostatic" code block is evaluated in macro-like fashion inside a dynamic code block. When a dynamic code block is defined, any pseudostatic blocks inside will be "baked" into the block permanently as what they evaluate to:

	x: 1;
	y: $random; // assume a random function exists
	block: $(int x){!{y} + x};
	

Equality is checked using any number of equal signs. {x = y} is just as valid as {x == y}, and even {x ============== y}.

when used on an assignment line, the token "it" may be used to refer to the value being assigned to:

	x: it+1; 
	
	// is the same as
	
	x: x+1;
	
	// is the same as
	
	x++;
	
this is a typing convenience for when a long or complicated name is used in the calculation for changing its own value. It is particularly convenient in instances like:

	this: *{ 
		variable: *{ 
			is: *{
				0;
			};
		};
	};
	nested: 0;
	
	this.variable.is@nested: it + 5;

Here is the fully featured dynamic code block syntax:

	$(args)[check-before]{codeblock}[check-after]
	
others follow the same syntax, but with a different or omitted signature character at the beginning.
	
static code block:
	
	(args)[check-before]{codeblock}[check-after]
	
pseudostatic code block:
	!(args)[check-before]{codeblock}[check-after]

Some example code
==================================================

sum: $int, int{
	x + y
};

amount: {x:1, y:2}~$sum;


{0;}~{i++;}[i < amount];
